# Entropia sample downloader bot
Bot that runs in the terminal and automatically downloads free samples based in a key-world and an amount in the freesound.org website.

Created with node.js and Puppeteer.

 ## To use the robot, open the file baixasample.js and change the username and password fields for your account credentials on freesound.org.
 (of course you must have an account for the bot to use :] )
  
  this is the part of the code to be changed:
  
  // achando o login e senha (campos) e preenchendo com os do usuÃ¡rio
  await page.type('#id_username', 'TYPE YOUR USER NAME HERE')
  await page.type('#id_password', 'TYPE YOUR PASSWORD HERE')


  ### after that just run:
  
  node baixasample.js
  
  
  
  For now the bot is configured to Portuguease lang only.
